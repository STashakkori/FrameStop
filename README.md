# FrameStop
FrameStop web code modules on its way to a chest of modular building blocks

Framestop may be quaint, but its written to be private to you and also
have a minimal attack surface. Over time hopefully there will be so many
modules in here that you can quickly grab the pieces you need and build
your website and let people's information be private to them.

Isn't this an internet you would like to surf? <3

Like I said quaint but still functional:
